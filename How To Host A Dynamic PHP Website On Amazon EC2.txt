Update the server using the following command

 4. Now copy and paste the public DNS of your instance in the address bar of the browser and click enter. If it shows a page showing the message “It Works” , It means you have successfully installed the web server in your instance. 

5. Uploading Web Pages to WWW Folder: After the web server has been installed you have to upload your web pages to the www folder of apache web server. You can locate the folder using the following command

 cd /var/www 
You can upload the files to your instance using filzilla client. If you never used filezilla client you can refer the following tutorial How To Upload Files To AWS Server Instance Using FileZilla 

By default www folder contains index.html. Remove that default index.html and start uploading your HTML, CSS and PHP files to the server inside www folder.

Index page of your website should have the name index.html. After uploading the files, if you go to your public DNS you can see the index page of your site. You can map your custom domain name to the EC2 instance using the elastic IP.
